# Question: How would you document the expected accuracy of the model going forward?.
# Describe succinctly a strategy.
#   Example given below

# Model documentation: 3 Choice cuts (Tenderloin, Butt CC, Butt boneless) price prediction
#
# Model summary:
#
# Dependent Variable: Trend component of tenderloin weighted average price
# Independent Variables: Trend and seasonal components of top sirloin boneless and cap-off prices
# Data Period: Weekly data from January 2017 to December 2022

# Training performance:
#
# R-squared: 0.45
# Adjusted R-squared: 0.44
# Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.025
# Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.035
#
# Test performance:
#
# R-squared: 0.42
# Adjusted R-squared: 0.41
# Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.027
# Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.038
#
# Out of sample error:
#
# The model was tested on data from 2023.
# Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.027
# Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.038
#
# Visualizations:
#
# Predicted vs Actual Values Plot: [Include scatter plot]
# Residual Plot: [Include residuals vs fitted values plot]
#
# Assumptions: (for example)
#
# The seasonality patterns for the beef cuts remain consistent over time.
# The historical data used for training is representative of future trends.
#
# Limitations:
#
# The model may not capture abrupt market changes or new trends not present in the historical data.
# Multicollinearity among predictors, indicated by high VIF values, may affect the stability of coefficient estimates.

# Monitoring and maintenance:
#
# Regularly update the model with new data to capture emerging trends and seasonality patterns.
# Re-evaluate the model performance quarterly using the latest data.
# Implement automated alerts for significant deviations in predictions to trigger model review and retraining.
